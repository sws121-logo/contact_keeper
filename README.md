# React Contact Manager Application

## Goal of the Project

The goal of this project is to create a contact management system where users can register, log in, and manage their contacts in a secure environment. The application provides CRUD functionality for managing contacts and protects user data using authentication and private routes.

## Purpose of the Project

This project is designed to:
- Implement a fully functional contact management system.
- Showcase the use of React with Context API for state management.
- Integrate user authentication with token-based security.
- Provide a responsive user interface for managing user contacts.
- Demonstrate private routing for authenticated users.

---

## Technology Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For routing within the application, including private routes.
- **Context API**: For global state management (authentication, contacts, and alerts).
- **Express and Node.js**: (On the backend, not covered in this front-end repository).
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For user authentication.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.

---

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and receive JWT tokens for authentication.
- **Private Routes**: Users must be authenticated to access certain routes, such as the contact management dashboard.
- **Contact Management**: Users can create, update, and delete contacts.
- **Alerts System**: A notification system for alerting users of errors, successes, or other important messages.
- **Global State Management**: The application manages state using the Context API, keeping the state of contacts, alerts, and authentication in sync.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** and **npm**: Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed.

### Steps to Run:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-contact-manager.git
   cd react-contact-manager
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   You need to create a `.env` file and set the following environment variables (you may also need backend URLs if you connect to a backend API):
   ```bash
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Access the Application**:
   Open the browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

## How It Works

### Key Components

- **Navbar**: Displays navigation links, conditionally renders based on authentication.
- **Home**: The main page where users can view and manage contacts.
- **About**: A static page providing information about the app.
- **Register and Login**: Pages for user registration and login.
- **PrivateRoute**: A component that ensures routes are accessible only to authenticated users.
- **Context API**: Manages authentication state, contact state, and alert state globally across the app.

### Authentication

- The app uses JWT-based authentication. If a token exists in localStorage, it's set in the `Authorization` header for all Axios requests using the `setAuthToken` utility.
- **Private Routes**: Users need to be authenticated to access certain routes like the home/dashboard page. Non-authenticated users will be redirected to the login page.

### Contact Management

- Users can create, update, and delete their contacts. Each contact contains a name, email, phone number, and contact type (personal or professional).
  
### Alerts

- The app displays alerts when a user performs certain actions, such as successfully logging in or encountering an error during registration.

## Future Enhancements

- **Backend Integration**: Connect the app to a Node.js backend for full CRUD operations and persistent data storage.
- **Enhanced Validation**: Add form validation for input fields like email and phone numbers.
- **Advanced User Management**: Enable users to reset their passwords and update their profiles.
- **Pagination for Contacts**: Add pagination for better management of large contact lists.
